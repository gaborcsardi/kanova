   Stomata patterns
}
\description{
   Point patterns of stomata at 18 locations in each of 12 leaves of
   \emph{Michelia cavaleriei var. platypetala.}
}
\usage{stomata}
\format{
  The object \code{stomata} is a hyperframe with 216 rows.  It has
  a column named \code{patterns} containing the point patterns of
  stomata locations, a column named \code{Leaf} which is a factor
  with levels 1 to 12 identifying the leaf from which the pattern
  was obtained, a column named \code{Layer} which is a factor with
  levels 1 to 6 identifying a location within each \dQuote{position}
  (see \dQuote{\code{Pos}}), and a column named \code{Pos} which
  is a factor with levels 1 to 3, position 1 being closest to the
  central stem of the leaf and position 3 being closest to the
  outer edge of the leaf (and farthest from the central stem).
}
\details{
  Each pattern was observed in a rectangular window of dimension
  1200 \eqn{\times}{x} 900 microns.
